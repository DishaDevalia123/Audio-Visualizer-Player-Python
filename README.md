# Audio-Visualizer-Player-Python
This is a Python-based project that allows users to play audio files while displaying real-time color-gradient visualizations of the sound waveforms.

Getting Started
To use this tool, follow the steps below:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run python Music_Player_def.py to launch the application.
Usage
Upon launching the application, you will be prompted to select an audio file to play. Once you have selected a file, the audio will begin playing and a real-time visualization of the sound waveform will be displayed.

You can pause, resume, and stop the audio playback using the corresponding buttons in the application. You can also adjust the volume of the audio using the slider in the application.
The application includes a graphical user interface (GUI) with a toolbar that contains two menus: "File" and "Theme."

The "File" menu provides options for selecting a music file or a folder containing multiple files. Once a file or folder is selected, the application will begin playing the music and generating a visualization of the audio waveform with color gardient by default. The "File" menu also includes options for customizing the colors used in the visualization.

The "Theme" menu provides two options: "Light Theme" and "Dark Theme." These options allow users to switch between a light or dark color scheme for the GUI. The light theme uses bright colors and white backgrounds, while the dark theme uses darker colors and black backgrounds.

Overall, the music player cum audio visualizer provides a user-friendly interface for playing and visualizing audio files, with options for customizing the visualization and GUI theme to suit individual preferences

Customization
This tool was designed to be easily customizable. You can adjust the colors, size, and style of the visualizations by modifying the code in Music_Player_def.py.
